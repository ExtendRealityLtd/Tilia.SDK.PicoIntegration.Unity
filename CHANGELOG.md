#### Features

* **structure:** add initial implementation of Pico SDK wrapper ([8d5e53a](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/Tilia.SDK.PicoIntegration.Unity/commit/8d5e53a0d268814c6993e5c89b4b42ab7632bd45))
  > The Pico Integration wrapper provides a way of being able to use the Pico Integration SDK for Unity directly with the TrackedAlias so the underlying Pico SDK can be leveraged whilst still keeping a level of generics to the project.
